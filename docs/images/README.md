This directory should contain the screenshot used on the repository overview.

To include the attached screenshot in the GitHub README (rendered on the project page), save the provided image into this folder with the filename:

```
duperanger_screenshot.png
```

After adding the image, commit and push it so GitHub can render it in the README.

Example (powershell):

```powershell
git add docs/images/duperanger_screenshot.png
git commit -m "Add DupeRanger screenshot for README"
git push
```

If you'd like me to add the image for you, upload the screenshot file into the repository and I'll commit it.
